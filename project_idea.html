<p>
Cars have always been my life, I first started my passion for cars at the age of 2.
Majority of my life involves cars, I play car games, work on my 1984 Nissan 300ZX (shown above), watch videos about cars and so it goes.

<p>
I've been playing games ever since the age of 3.
My first ever game was Need For Speed Underground 1, loved that game to bits, I still play games religously to this day.
Not all the games I play today are related to cars, some are FPS and whatnot.

<p>
When I was 4, my dad had 2 PCs, one for work the other for games, I always used his gaming PC which started my passion for Computers.
I've even built my own Gaming PC that I use (shown above), plus I've even helped friends with their PC builds for fun.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun"> Guns</a>

<p>
When I was younger I had a minor interest towards guns, it grew alot on me recently thanks to Call Of Duty.
My favourite guns would have to be the FN FAL Assault Rifle (my custom FN FAL shown above) and the Barrett M82A1 Sniper Rifle.

<p>
I enjoy using social media to look at memes, videos, learn stuff, etc.
The main perk about social media is that you're able to socialise with friends with such ease.
Which allows you to plan friendly catch ups and whatnot.

    <h2>Hanging out with friends</h2>

<p>
Another thing I enjoy are my friends, we usually play games together and share jokes with one another, we've always got each others' back. I'm very thankful for my friends.
